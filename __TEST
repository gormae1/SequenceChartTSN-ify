                         Sequence Chart State and Behavior

1 State
=======

Variables that determine the sequence chart.

 - input: the eventlog file
 - open modules: any subset of all simple and compound modules ever seen in the eventlog file
 - events: all events or a subset defined by an event filter
 - axis ordering: one of the automatic setting or manual
 - timeline mode: linear and various non-linear mappings between simulation time and pixels
 - timeline position and zoom factor
 - selection: one or more events/axes/message sends/method calls/simulation times
 - bookmarks: one or more events/axes/message sends/method calls/simulation times
 - show/hide flags for various parts of the chart
 - permanent error message in case of an internal error

3 Behavior
==========

User inputs that change the sequence chart state.

Keyboard
--------
 - f5
   clears the permanent error message and refreshes the chart
 - tab
   shows/hides time differences between selected events and simulation times
 - delete
   removes the selected events by adding them the eventlog filter and enables filtering
 - left arrow
   moves the selection to the previous event
 - control left arrow
   moves the selection to the cause event
 - shift left arrow
   moves the selection to the previous event in the same module
 - right arrow
   moves the selection to the next event
 - control right arrow
   moves the selection to the first consequence event
 - shift right arrow
   moves the selection to the next event in the same module
 - up arrow
   scrolls up with axis spacing
 - down arrow
   scrolls down with axis spacing
 - page up
   scrolls up with viewport height
 - page down
   scrolls down with viewport height
 - home
   goes to the first event if visible or to the first simulation time
 - end
   goes to the last event if visible or to the last simulation time
 - keypad plus
   zooms in
 - keypad minus
   zooms out
 - keypad multiply
   default zoom
 - control f
   opens find text dialog
 - control k
   finds next match starting from the current selection
 - control g
   opens go to event number dialog
 - control shift g
   opens go to simulation time dialog
 - control t
   toggles bookmarks for the current selection

Mouse
-----
 - left click
   - on event/message send/method call/axis/simulation time
     selects/deselects
   - on axis expand/collapse/close icons
     expands/collapses/closes the axis
 - control Left click
   adds/removes to selection event/message send/method call/axis/simulation time
 - right click
   opens context menu
 - left double click
   - on message dependency
     zooms on message dependency
   - on axis header or axis header module label
     opens module
   - on axis module or axis label
     opens module
 - control left double click
   - on axis header or axis header module label
     opens module recursively
   - on axis module or axis label
     opens module recursively
 - mouse wheel
   scrolls vertically
 - shift mouse wheel
   scrolls horizontally
 - control mouse wheel
   zoom in/out
 - hover
   highlight and describe what's under the mouse: events/message sends/method calls/axes/simulation time
 - drag
   scroll horizontally and vertically
 - resize
   automatically change axis spacing if axes are balanced

Context menu
------------
 - select modules
   changes the set of displayed modules
 - preset configurations
   changes the show/hide flags for various use cases
 - timeline mode
   - linear
   - event number
   - step
   - non-linear
   - custom
 - ordering mode
   - module id
   - module path
   - minimize crossings
   - manual
 - filter
   opens the eventlog filter dialog which can be used to specify the filter parameters
 - pin
   when not pinned, follows the selection of other workbench parts for the same eventlog
 - release memory
   frees all memory allocated for the eventlog file and reloads the necessary parts, the chart is unchanged
 - copy to clipboard
   copies the currently visible area as an image to the clipboard
 - export to SVG
   opens the export SVG dialog

Event context menu
------------------

 - TODO

Message send context menu
-------------------------

 - TODO

Method call context menu
------------------------

 - TODO

Axis context menu
-----------------

 - remove module
 - expand compound module
   - one level
   - all levels recursively
 - collapse compound module
   - to one level
   - to itself
 - open module
   - submodule one level deep
   - parent module one level deep
   - specific module one level deep

Toolbar
-------

 - similar to context menu

Vertical scroll bar
-------------------

 - standard behavior

Horizontal scroll bar
---------------------

 - dragging
   jumps to approximate event at the relative position

Navigation history
------------------

 - forward
   navigates to next location by restoring simulation time and range
 - backward
   navigates to previous location by restoring simulation time and range

Configuration
-------------

 - stores configuration automatically on close
 - restores configuration automatically on open
 - stored configuration is persistent between sessions
 - presets
   - network configuration
   - full detail
   - default
   - empty

Bookmarks
---------

 - event/message send/method call/axis/simulation time
 - persistent between sessions
 - can be navigated to by double clicking

Tooltip
-------

 - TODO

Linked eventlog table
---------------------

 - follows selection

Laziness
--------

 - supports large files several GBs
 - opens file begin and opens file end in constant time and space
 - allows any potential long running operation to be cancelled
   the chart displays a permanent message stating that it was cancelled
   parameters can be changed and chart must be refreshed

Eventlog file
-------------

 - if file is appended
   reflects the new content, if the current position is at the end, the chart scrolls with the new content
 - if file is overwritten
   reloads the file and jumps to the beginning
 - if file is deleted
   becomes empty

Filtering
---------

 - TODO

Viewer vs Editor
----------------
