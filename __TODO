Sequence chart
--------------

Errors:

-Some elog files are taking too long to load, the IDE freezes (e.g. fragmentation showcase/DCFfrag.elog)
-Some files are taking even longer to load (or didn't wait for it to finish loading)(e.g. fragmentation/HCFfrag.elog)
-When a sequence chart loads, it's zoomed out all the way
-When axis vector data is shown, the numbers are too big (seems to be a UI scaling issue; when scaling is off, they fit in the rectangle)
-Export to svg: when exporting the whole event log, the timeline doesn't reach the end of the event log
-Sometimes the - icon next to a small module rectangle doesn't fit in the rectangle; when the mouse pointer is over it, the - icon is outside the rectangle;
 when trying to move the mouse over the - icon, it disappears; nevertheless, when clicked in its place, it does its job, so minimizes the module rectangle
 seems to be a very minor issue though
-Error when setting timeline to linear/sometimes just crash
-90MB elog file (wireless07), everything very slow
-very slow/unresponsive when timeline is on nonlinear; works ok when on linear (txop showcase, 14MB elog file)

Feature ideas:

-Undo/Redo of changes in the sequence chart view (e.g. clicked close on the module label in the axis header; want to get it back with ctrl-z)
 should work for changes in the view, like filtering, zooming, shown modules, selection of arrows/others in the top row of buttons, maybe bookmarks (?)
 but not for scroll position, selection of modules
-Legend-like help for keyboard shortcuts/the described stuff in the __TEST file
-Some keyboard shortcut to select multiple events, e.g. Shift+Ctrl left/right arrow -> would select all events or just the ones in the current module
-The cogwheel icon (Preset Configuration) doesn't do anything, just the dropdown menu
-File size in MB or kB in eventlog info


 - make sure axis header label is always visible (min/max scroll into visible area)
 - remove /message dependencies/method calls/etc.
 - non-overlapping labels
 - module axis order, switch between manual/minimized crossings
 - fix duplicate entries in manual axis order KLUDGE in the code
 - eventlog table row width/canvas width is fixed, content may be outside of viewport
 - deleted file causes rendering error
 - use color gradient for integer vector data?

 + remove individual axes/events
 + automatic module state vector annotation
 + bookmark timeline coordinates/axes/message sends/method calls
 + show how many axes are not visible but open
 + show if the event is actually in that module or only inherited from descendant
 + bookmark events/simulation times
 + image and coloring in ModuleTreeViewer
 + configure -> preset
 + horizontal event stretch
 + module axis navigation, drill down, etc.
 + draw arrows when both ends are available
 + preload small files
